this is a simple gaming platform web site made for learning purposes to master react
i made it as a chalenge by myself it's a project in react's course "code with mosh"

Features
_the data is fetched from a real web server the api is provided by "rawg" gaming platform 
_this app shows video games from different genres and platforms
_you can filter them by genre and by platform
_you search for any game by its name on the search bar
_you can sort the games by name alphabeticly or by realease date or by the addition date to the platform or rating..

Note
_before runing it make sure to install CORS extention for the browser where you run this app to avoid any error when fetching data from the server

this a project is realy simple and i didn't want to extend its features as it for learning purposes
